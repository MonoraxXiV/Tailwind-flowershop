# Tailwind-flowershop

This repository is made by MonoraxXiV as a self study to learn tailwind.
The self set objectives for this page is to:  
- Get faster at setting up a tailwind project.
- learn to customize tailwind colors and fonts.
- Learn the differences between extend and replacing in tailwind.config.
- work with colors.

This was also made alongside my [tailwind workshop](https://github.com/MonoraxXiV/Workshop-tailwind-css).  

## How to use this project.
Either look at the link featured in the github repository or clone the project and use npm run build.
If you are unfamiliar with tailwind I would recommend looking at the workshop first.
